# Manufacturing the Flywheel Shaft

The flywheel shaft is a central component of the bicycle. It is the axis the flywheel will rotate on. Thus, it needs to be solid and whistand the forces meant to counter the bike's tilt.

For those reasons, we did not 3D-print this shaft, but manufactured a steel shaft instead.

## Tips

Don't be scared to reduce the length a little bit. As you can see on pictures, our shaft was a bit too long.

::: tip
While manufacturing the steel shaft, make sure to stabilize it on both of its ends so that it does not bend during the process.

The flywheel shaft was the last missing component. Now that all parts are available, we can start the actual assembly of the bike.
