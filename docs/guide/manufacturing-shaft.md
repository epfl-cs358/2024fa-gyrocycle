# Manufacturing the Flywheel Shaft

The flywheel shaft is a central component of the bicycle. It is the axis the flywheel will rotate on. Thus, it needs to be solid and whistand the forces meant to counter the bike's tilt.

For those reasons, we did not 3D-print this shaft, but manufactured a steel shaft instead.

::: tip TODO
Add a download link for the shaft's 3D model.

::: tip TODO
Ask the person who manufactured the shaft what I can write here.

::: tip TODO
Add a picture of the flywheel shaft.

::: tip TODO
Stabilize the shaft while manufacturing it on both sides to avoid it wigling.

The flywheel shaft was the last missing component. Now that all parts are available, we can start the actual assembly of the bike.
