# Prerequisites

Unlink open-source software, open-hardware requires you to *build* the thing. Hence, you will need access to some tools to manufacture the bike:

- **3D Printer**
    
    Parts of the bicycle have to be 3D-printed. You will need access to a 3D-printer that can print with [**PETG**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyethylene_terephthalate) and [**TPU**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermoplastic_polyurethane) (for the bike's tires).

    ::: tip TODO
    Provide minimal dimensions for the 3D printer plate
    :::

- **Laser Cutter**

    The bike's rigid frame is made out of [MDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medium-density_fibreboard). Ideally, you will need a laser-cutter to manufacture its parts, as it needs to be quite precise.

    ::: tip TODO
    Provide minimal dimensions for the laser cutter

- **Soldering Equipment**

    The bicycle consists of several electronical components that need to be wired together. Most of the connections require cables to be [soldered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soldering) together or to a board.

::: tip TODO
Add the equipment for manufacturing the shaft
:::

::: tip TODO
Add equipment to drill holes into the MDF parts where they are missing.

In addition to those tools, you will need actual components and pieces to assemble the bicycle and make it work, move and balance. This is described in the next section, the Bill of Materials (BoM).
