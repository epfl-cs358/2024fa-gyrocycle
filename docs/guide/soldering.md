# Soldering

GyroCycle requires you to solder a few wires together to properly work. Below is a description of what cables need to be soldered where.

## Soldering to the MPU6050

You will need to solder five **female connectors** to the MPU6050 sensor. A length of approximately 10 centimeters is fine for those. The wires need to be connected to

- `VCC`
- `GND`
- `SCL`
- `SDA`
- `INT`
