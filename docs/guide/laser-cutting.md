# Laser-Cut Parts

The bike's rigid frame is made out of MDF `5mm`. You will need a laser cutter to manufacture those pieces in a precise way.

::: info
Files for laser-cutting MDF parts are provided. Note however that some of the screw holes were not added to the CAD. Hence, you might have to drill additional screw holes yourself if they are not already laser-cut.

::: tip TODO
Add a warning to add a hole or something to see the bottom pulley of the flywheel instead of having to unmount everything.

Following is the list of parts to be laser-cut in an MDF plate, divided into two parts:

1. Parts for the bicycle itself
2. Parts for the bicycle's stand

Here is the list of parts to be laser-cut in an MDF plate:

::: tip TODO
Export the parts to be laser-cut and put links here to the files along with quantities to be laser-cut for each piece.
:::

::: tip TODO
Add pictures of the laser-cut MDF parts when possible. Or make a table with each link, quantities but also a picture of the obtained piece.

Once you have 3D-printed necessary parts and laser-cut others, you still need to manufacture a central piece of the bicycle: the metal shaft for the flywheel. This is the subject of the next section.
