# 3D-Printed Parts

Some parts of the bike need to be 3D-printed. All parts are to be printed in [**PETG**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyethylene_terephthalate), except the bike's tires that are to be printed in [**TPU**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermoplastic_polyurethane) for better elasticity.

Below is a list of `.stl` files to be 3D-printed, along with how many of each must be printed and in what material.

::: tip
You can download all of the `.stl` files as a single `.zip` with <a href="/zip/gyrocycle-parts-to-3d-print.zip" download>this link</a>.

Once all 3D parts have been printed, the power supply circuitry of the bicycle needs to be soldered together, which is detailed in the next section.
