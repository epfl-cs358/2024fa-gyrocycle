# Glossary

Some particular words are used for specific meanings in the context of GyroCycle. Those meanings are described here.

## Child Wheels

In the context of GyroCycle, *child wheels* refer to the safety part of the bike that prevents the bicycle from completely falling on its side. Instead, it stops the fall at a reasonable angle, hence its name.

## Flywheel

GyroCycle uses a *flywheel* to balance. A flywheel is a wheel that rotates to resist changes in motion and counter some other force, in our case the tilt of the bicycle.

When we say flywheel we refer to the big flywheel component at the back of the bicycle.

## Stand

In the context of GyroCycle, the stand is the support structure we built to hold the bicycle upright when it is not balancing, allowing us to showcase it.
