# GyroCycle

Welcome to our documentation website!

GyroCycle is a course project worked on as part of the [CS-358 course at EPFL](https://edu.epfl.ch/coursebook/en/making-intelligent-things-a-CS-358-A) by a group of five students.

This is the end product:

## Features

The bicycle is designed to balance itself, meaning that when started, it will measure its tilt angle, and rotate the gray flywheel accordingly to compensate for the tilt and stay upright.

One can also connect to the bicycle from a mobile phone using [RemoteXY](https://remotexy.com/en/download/). This way, one can tell the bicycle to steer right and left, and to drive forward and backward.

## Try it

We provide detailed instructions and documents to build your own GyroCycle. See the [guide](./guide/) for more information.

## Video

Here you can see the bike in action (with the noise it makes...).
